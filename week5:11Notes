// Agile //

- Not to be defined as a methodology
    * … is actually a set of principles and values
    * a collection of beliefs used to guide decisions making when developing software

- Agile Manifesto
  * Left side matters more than right side of list
  * Individuals and Interactions > Process n Tools
  * Working software > Documentation

- 12 Principles of Agile:
(1)Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
(2)Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
(3)Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
(4)Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
(5)Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
(6)The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
(7)Working software is the primary measure of progress.
(8)Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
(9)Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
(10)Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
(11)The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
(12)At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.


// Unit Testing //

- A real purpose is not overwhelm myself from complex problems
- Making sure each component is doing what you think it should be doing lmao

// Git Syncing //

// // // this is used we we are in collaboration projects. // // //
-Repository URLS
  * the URL setup: http://host/path/to/repo.git

-Git Remote : allows us to connect to other repositories
  * found in the .config file
  * git remote add <name> <url> (whatever the URL is fr)
  * -f option is a git fetch <name>
  * Example: $ git remote add fake_test https://bitbucket.com/upstream_user/reponame.git; [remote "remote_test"]
   url = https://bitbucket.com/upstream_user/reponame.git
   fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/remote_test/*
